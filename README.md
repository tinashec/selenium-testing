Hands on project following http://www.tjmaher.com/2016/05/webdriver-development-environment-setup.html. The tutorial lays the foundation on how to write automated tests for web-based applications using Selenium WebDriver.
The project is a stepping stone in setting up an automated test framework for my current employee and to serve as a training resource for the rest of the team.
